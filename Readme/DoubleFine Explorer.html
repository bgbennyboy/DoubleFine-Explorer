		<p class="style7"><strong><em>What is DoubleFine Explorer?:</em></strong><br>
		An explorer tool for games by Double Fine Productions. It supports games that use the Moai and the Buddah engine. Thats all the games released since Psychonauts.<br>
		It does the following:
		
	<ul class="style7">
		<li>Lets you browse through the game's files and dump individual files/all files.</li>
		<li>Lets you play and dump the audio (music, speech and sfx).</li>
		<li>Displays the images as you browse and lets you save them as PNG's or DDS files.</li>
		<li>Decodes and displays the scripts and csv text as you browse through the files.</li>
	</ul>		
		
	</p>

	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>What games are supported?:</strong></em><br> 
	The pc versions of the following games are supported. Versions for other platforms should work but are untested.
			<ul class="style7">
		<li>Broken Age</li>
		<li>Brutal Legend</li>
		<li>Costume Quest</li>
		<li>Costume Quest 2</li>
		<li>Iron Brigade</li>
		<li>Stacking</li>
		<li>The Cave</li>
		<li>The Amnesia Fortnight prototypes should work but aren't really tested</li>
	</ul>	
	</p>
	

	<p class="style7"><em><strong>How to use it:</strong></em><br>
	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Open</i></u> and either click on open folder or choose one of the games and the game folder will automatically be found. Choose a .~h file to browse the data or go to the audio folder and choose a .fsb file to browse the audio.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save File</i></u> to save a file. Different options will appear here depending on the type of file you've selected.</li><br>

		<li class="style7">Click <i><u>Save All Files</i></u> to save all files. Different options will be available here depending on the type of files available in the currently open resource file.</li><br>
	</ul>
		<p class="style7">Filtering the files:</p>

	<ul>
		<li class="style7">Click on the <i><u>View</i></u> button to show a list of all the different file types, selecting one of these changes the view so that only these file types are visible.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view and show all files, click the button again and click <i><u>View All Files</i></u>.</li> 
	</ul>	
		<p class="style7">Searching the files:</p>
	<ul>

		<li class="style7">To search just type in the search box. Searching ignores any filter that you've used. I.e. the view will be reset to 'All Files'. The search looks in file names and is an 'instant search' - the search happens as you type.</li><br>
		<li class="style7">To reset the view either delete the text in the search box or click the View button and select View all files.</li><br>
	</ul>

	</p>

	
	<p class="style7"  id="limitations"><em><strong>Limitations/bugs:</strong></em><br> 
		There are a few  audio files that don't decode correctly. This is probably because they use a different codec, I'll look into this in the future. There are known problems with UI.fsb in The Cave and with 5 fsb files in Iron Brigade.
	</p>
	
	<p class="style7"><em><strong>Extra hidden stuff:</strong></em><br>
		There is a hidden button that can automatically extract a file and open it in a hex editor.<br>
		To enable this feature you need to make a DoublefineExplorer.ini file in the same place as the program. Inside it should look like this:<br><br>
		
		&nbsp;&nbsp;[Settings]<br>
		&nbsp;&nbsp;Hexeditor=C:\Program Files\BreakPoint Software\Hex Workshop v6\HWorks32.exe<br><br>
		
		Obviously Hexeditor should point to the path of your chosen hex editor.<br>
		When the ini is present the button will appear. Files that are sent to the hex editor are first dumped to the temp folder. The program keeps track of what files it has saved here and when you open a new file or close the program it will delete them (though it obviously cant delete any files that are still open in the hex editor).
